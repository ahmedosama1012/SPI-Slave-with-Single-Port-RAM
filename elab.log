WARNING: [Synth 8-4767] Trying to implement RAM 'mem_1_reg' in registers. Block RAM or DRAM implementation is not possible; see log for reasons.
Reason is one or more of the following :
	1: RAM is sensitive to asynchronous reset signal. this RTL style is not supported. 
RAM "mem_1_reg" dissolved into registers
